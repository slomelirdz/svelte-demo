# Svelte Demo

Created by Sandra Lomeli.

Hi! This is my first project in Svelte. I created it using Vite, choosing Svelte and JavaScript as my stack.
Other resources and packages I've used include:

- Sass as the css processor.
- JSONplaceholder, endpoint to simulate the behavior of a real API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
- AutoAnimate for transition animations (https://auto-animate.formkit.com/).
- TablerICONS for iconography (https://tabler-icons.io/).
- Css-loaders for loader animation (https://css-loaders.com/).
- Installed the Svelte extension for VS Code.

## Install and Start

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
